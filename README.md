# 🧬 Clinical Trials + Bio Evidence Intelligence Dashboard

A **live, end-to-end analytics dashboard** that combines public clinical trial metadata with an **explainable biological evidence scoring system** to support **early risk assessment, prioritization, and signal discovery** in drug development.

🔗 **Live App:** https://trial-bio-intel.streamlit.app/  
📦 **GitHub Repo:** https://github.com/aparna32/trial-bio-intel-dashboard

## 🎯 Project Objective

Clinical trials fail expensively and often late. This project explores a practical question:

> **Can early biological signals (from trial descriptions and metadata) be used to flag risk, prioritize trials, and surface promising candidates — before outcomes are known?**

This dashboard is **not a prediction model**. It is an **explainable signal-strength heuristic** designed for:
- Research analysts  
- Clinical strategy teams  
- Bioinformatics & translational science roles  
- Risk / portfolio intelligence use cases

## 🧠 What This Dashboard Does

### 1. Fetches & processes live trial data
- Source: **ClinicalTrials.gov**
- Automated via **Python + R pipeline**
- Weekly refresh using **GitHub Actions**

### 2. Computes a Bio Evidence Score (0–100)
Each trial receives a score based on:
- Trial phase (later phase = higher weight)
- Recruitment status
- Biological & mechanistic keywords in:
  - Title
  - Conditions
  - Intervention descriptions  

The score is:
- Fully explainable  
- Deterministic (no black-box ML)
- Designed for analyst interpretation  

### 3. Interactive exploration
- Filter by status, phase, sponsor, score
- Rank trials by biological signal
- Identify:
  - ⚠️ Late-phase trials with weak evidence
  - 👀 High-signal recruiting trials
  - 🧪 Sponsors with concentrated activity

## 🔬 Bio Evidence Score — How It Works

The score is a **heuristic signal**, not a prediction.

**Components:**
- Phase weight  
- Status weight  
- Keyword evidence:
  - Biological terms (e.g. gene, RNA, biomarker)
  - Mechanistic terms (e.g. inhibitor, antibody)

**Why this matters:**
- Late-stage trials with weak biological grounding are risky
- Early-stage trials with strong mechanistic clarity deserve attention
- This mirrors real-world biotech portfolio discussions
